  abstract = {Missing data is a widespread problem that can affect the ability to use data to construct effective prediction systems. We investigate a common machine learning technique that can tolerate missing values, namely C4.5, to predict cost using six real world software project databases. We analyze the predictive performance after using the k-NN missing data imputation technique to see if it is better to tolerate missing data or to try to impute missing values and then apply the C4.5 algorithm. For the investigation, we simulated three missingness mechanisms, three missing data patterns, and five missing data percentages. We found that the k-NN imputation can improve the prediction accuracy of C4.5. At the same time, both C4.5 and k-NN are little affected by the missingness mechanism, but that the missing data pattern and the missing data percentage have a strong negative impact upon prediction (or imputation) accuracy particularly if the missing data percentage exceeds 40%.}

  abstract = {Long short-term memory (LSTM) has been widely applied to real-time automated natural gas leak detection and localization. However, LSTM approach could not provide the interpretation that this leak position is localized instead of other positions. This study proposes a leakage detection and localization approach by integrating the attention mechanism (AM) with the LSTM network. In this hybrid network, a fully-connected neural network behaving as AM is first applied to assign initial weights to time-series data. LSTM is then used to discover the complex correlation between the weighted data and leakage positions. A labor-scale pipeline leakage experiment of an urban natural gas distribution network is conducted to construct the benchmark dataset. A comparison between the proposed approach and the state-of-the-arts is also performed. The results demonstrate our proposed approach exhibits higher accuracy with AUC = 0.99. Our proposed approach assigns a higher attention weight to the sensor close to the leakage position, indicating the variation of data from the sensor has a significant influence on leakage localization. It corresponds that the closer to the leakage position, the larger variation of monitoring pressure after leakage, which enhances the detection results' trustiness. This study provides a transparent and robust alternative for real-time automatic pipeline leak detection and localization, which contributes to constructing a digital twin of emergency management of urban pipeline leakage.}
